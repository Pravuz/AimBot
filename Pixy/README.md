<h1>Pixy</h1>
</br>
<b>Q:</b> Where does the magic happen?</br>
<b>A:</b> In the GreyShades class (pixy/gcc/video/proggreyshades.h\cpp)</br>
</br>
<b>Q:</b> How does it work?</br>
<b>A:</b> GreyShades attempts to identify moving objects by tracking changes in individual pixel values (luminosity). </br>Because of certain limitations, the filtering of objects is quite rough however. </br>
</br>
<b>Q:</b> Why is it called greyshades?</br>
<b>A:</b> Because it's not based on colors, but shades of grey ( sizeOf(uint8_t)-1 different shades in fact).</br>
</br>
<b>Q:</b> What else can this firmware do?</br>
<b>A:</b> Not much. This firmware is based on an early pre-alpha gcc build by CharmedLabs, stripped down to rule out potential </br>crashes/resource usage/bugs.</br>
</br>
<b>Q:</b> Will this firmware work on my Pixy?</br>
<b>A:</b> Maybe, I'm not certain Pixymon will allow flashing your pixy with the .hex generated by this code. I used a</br> debugger (LPC-Link2) to test and upload the firmware. </br>
</br>
<b>Q:</b> Is this currently a work in progress?</br>
<b>A:</b> This project was part of a bachelor's project, which is now finished. The source code found here will remain as is, </br>with no guarantee or promises with it. </br>
</br>
<b>Q:</b> Can I use your code as I please?</br>
<b>A:</b> Yes, by all means! Some credit would be nice however :)</br>
</br>
<b>Q:</b> Can I contact you?</br>
<b>A:</b> Yes, preferably via github (I'm Pravuz). I'm not promising any reply, as I'm quite busy nowadays. </br>
