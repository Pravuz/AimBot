<h1>Pixy</h1>

<b>Q:</b> Where does the magic happen?
<b>A:</b> In the GreyShades class (pixy/gcc/video/proggreyshades.h\cpp)

<b>Q:</b> How does it work?
<b>A:</b> GreyShades attempts to identify moving objects by tracking changes in individual pixel values (luminosity). </br>Because of certain limitations, the filtering of objects is quite rough however. 

<b>Q:</b> Why is it called greyshades?
<b>A:</b> Because it's not based on colors, but shades of grey ( sizeOf(uint8_t)-1 different shades in fact).

<b>Q:</b> What else can this firmware do?
<b>A:</b> Not much. This firmware is based on an early pre-alpha gcc build by CharmedLabs, stripped down to rule out potential </br>crashes/resource usage/bugs.

<b>Q:</b> Will this firmware work on my Pixy?
<b>A:</b> Maybe, I'm not certain Pixymon will allow flashing your pixy with the .hex generated by this code. I used a debugger (LPC-Link2) to test and upload the firmware. 

<b>Q:</b> Is this currently a work in progress?
<b>A:</b> This project was part of a bachelor's project, which is now finished. The source code found here will remain as is, </br>with no guarantee or promises with it. 

<b>Q:</b> Can I use your code as I please?
<b>A:</b> Yes, by all means! Some credit would be nice however :)

<b>Q:</b> Can I contact you?
<b>A:</b> Yes, preferably via github (I'm Pravuz). I'm not promising any reply, as I'm quite busy nowadays.
